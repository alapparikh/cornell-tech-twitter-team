This app is a prototype. 

Based on Google Maps data, it displays places of interest around the user. On selecting a place, the user can view Tweets about this place (this is, however, not entirely error proof currently). The hope is to encourage location enabled Tweets as well as allow users to see what is happening around them real time, including specifically about a location they are interested in (be it a cafe, bar, museum or park).
